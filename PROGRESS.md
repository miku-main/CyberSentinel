# append daily logs here
### 1 - Bootstrap
**What I built:**
- Repo scaffolded with virtualenv, requirements, Makefile, base package, and smoke tests.
**How I tested it:**
- `make setup && make test` passed; `make run-app` shows placeholder UI.
**Notes:**
- RL/torch deps deferred to later to keep install light.
**Next up:**
- 2 - Synthetic data generator and parsers.
